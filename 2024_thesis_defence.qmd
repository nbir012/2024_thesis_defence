-   By 2050, global population will increase to 9.7 billion (U.N., 2019)
-   Estimated increase in protein consumption between 32 - 43% (Henchion et al., 2017)
:::

:::

::: notes
- 9.7
- 32 - 43%
- Pressure on our existing food systems
:::

## Insects as Food

-   FAO suggests insect protein be used to meet demand
-   Many perceived advantages over traditional livestock

::: notes
-   High feed conversion efficiency
- Utilise unconventional feed sources
-   Incredibly diverse order of animals
-   Grow in high densities

-   I sought to address this
-   started off by looking at the social context in which insects have been used
-   prior to investigating the biology of an important endemic edible insect species

# Chapter 2: A review of insects as food in Aotearoa New Zealand

## Edible insect catalogue

-   Identified species with traditional and contemporary uses
-   Analysed social and legislative landscape
-   recorded companies marketing edible insect products

## Findings

-   Identified 21 insects species
-   at least 10 endemic/native species:

::: columns
::: {.column style="width: 50%; font-size: 70%;"}
-   *Prionoplus reticularis*, huhu grub
-   *Aenetus virescens*, pūriri moth
-   *Pyronota festiva*, mānuka beetle
-   *Costelytra zealandica* / *Odontria zealandica*, tūtaeruru/grass grub
-   *Locusta migratoria*, migratory locust
:::

::: {.column style="width: 50%; font-size: 70%;"}
-   *Teleogryllus commodus*, black field cricket
-   *Agrius convolvuli* kumara moth/hīhue
-   *Kikihia muta*, kihikihi kai
-   Tortricidae family - species unknown tīkopa/leaf rollers
-   *Archichauliodes diversus*, puene
:::
:::

## Findings

-   In last 10 years:
    -   Eight companies have sold edible insects/insect-based products
    -   Only two are still trading/marketing products

## Findings

![](media/c_2/companies_marketing_top_words.png){width="1200"}

::: notes
-   Words used in marketing and mission statements of these 8 companies
-   cricket, protein, flour used a lot (reflects the products they were selling)
-   words associated with sustainability were also used frequently
:::

## Findings

![](media/c_2/companies_marketing_companies_number.png){width="1200"}

::: notes
-   However there is little evidence on companies websites to suggest that they are actually sustainable
-   most (but not all) relied on ingredients imported from Thailand or Canada which would likely impact enviro footprint
-   this may lead to mistrust with consumers if found out
:::

# Chapter 3: The use, perception, and existing knowledge of insects as food in Aotearoa New Zealand

## Knowledge and use of insects as food

::: {.incremental}
-   620 participants
-   59.2% had eaten insects
-   76.0% participants were likely to eat in future
-   80.3% people could name one or more species
-   48.1% people named crickets
-   53.7% people named the huhu grub
:::

::: notes
- 60% eaten insect
- 76% likely to eat in future
- 80% could name a species
- 48% named crickets
- 54% named huhu grub 
:::

## Factors which influence likelihood of eating insects (logistic regression)

-   Factors influencing future likelihood:
    -   [Prior experience]{.fragment .highlight-green}
    -   [Existing Knowledge]{.fragment .highlight-green} (# of species named)
    -   [Food neophobia score]{.fragment .highlight-red}

::: notes
-   Prior experience and increasing knowledge of edible species were significant positive factors
-   Food neophobia score was a significant negative factor
:::

## Unconscious Bias

![](media/c_3/sentiment_group.svg){width="1200"}

::: notes
-   Asked people to list the first words or phrases that came to mind when they saw a particular menu ingredient (e.g. beef, tofu, silkworm pupae)
-   Despite participants overall willingness to eat insects, insect ingredients had significantly lower sentiment scores in the words used to describe them.
:::

## Unconscious Bias

![](media/c_3/sentiment_item.svg){width="1200"}

::: notes
-   Cricket flour is actually has very positive sentiment scores
-   huhu grubs are broadly comparable to lamb and tofu
-   words with "worm" or "pupae" in them elicit greater disgust
:::

## Words associated with cricket flour

::: columns
::: {.column style="width: 50%; font-size: 70%;"}
-   Positive
    -   "curious"
    -   "interesting"
-   Environmentally friendly
    -   "green"
    -   "environmental"
    -   "alternative"
:::

    -   "gluten free"
-   Culinary applications
    -   "bread"
    -   "pancake"

:::
:::

## Words associated with huhu grubs

::: columns
::: {.column style="width: 50%; font-size: 70%;"}
-   Ecology:
    -   "native"
    -   "bush"
    -   "beetle"

-   Flavour profile and texture:
    -   "peanut butter"

    -   "slimy"
:::

## Huhu beetle is well known

-   Huhu Beetle (*Prionoplus reticularis*) is widely recognised in Aotearoa
-   Research has tended to focus on the huhu grub as a pest of timber industry
-   There is a gap in knowledge of the biology of huhu beetles

::: notes
-   This presents an opportunity to investigate this species whilst also exploring the potential of a novel technique for identifying the geographic provenance of insects
:::

# Chapter 4: The metabolomic fingerprint of an edible insect species, *P. reticularis*, along a latitudinal gradient {.r-fit-text}

## Can we use the metabolomic profile of an insect to determine which geographic location it came from?

```{r map}
#| echo: false

metab_map <- leaflet::leaflet() %>%
  leaflet::addProviderTiles(providers$Stadia.StamenWatercolor) %>% 
  leaflet::addCircles(lng=df_metab_fieldsites$longitude, lat=df_metab_fieldsites$latitude, weight = 20, color = "purple")

metab_map

```

::: notes
-   collecting grubs along a latitudinal gradient
-   Used GC-MS along with two derivatisation techniques to identify metabolites
-   Assessed which derivatisation technique had was most effective at predicting correct location of a species
:::

## Findings (PERMANOVA)

### Methyl chloroformate (MCF):

-   Location, larval weight, log and log temperature were all significant.
    -   Location only explained [12.3%]{.fragment .highlight-red} of the variation in the model

### Trimethylsilyl (TMS):

-   Only location was significant.
    -   Location explained [31.1%]{.fragment .highlight-red} of the variation in the model

## Ramdom Forest Classification Model

-   TMS had the highest accuracy, predicting the correct location of a sample [72.2%]{.fragment .highlight-red} of the time
-   MCF had a lower accuracy of [68.1%]{.fragment .highlight-red}
    -   The field site of Kaingaroa had the highest error rate which impacted overall accuracy

    -   Proline was the metabolite with greatest relative abundance in MCF
    -   both are known to be utilised for energy in other insects

# Chapter 5: The static allometry of traits associated with fitness in *P. reticularis*

## Exploring the mating system of an edible insect species

-   Measured traits important in scramble competition mating systems
    -   body size
    -   wing size
    -   antennal size
    -   locomotory performance

## Findings

![](media/c_5/flight_graphs.png){width="1200"}

::: notes
-   a glm (gamma distribution with log link) was used to assess how wing dimensions affect performance
-   Wing loading (PW and WAR) was significant for all three measures of flight performance
-   incr. wing loading is associated with fast but inefficient flight
-   Speed can maximise \# females male can encounter
:::

## Sexual dimorphism

-   Male antennae were significantly larger than female antennae
-   Females were significantly larger in all other traits.

## Allometry

| Trait           | Male | Female |
|-----------------|:----:|:------:|
| Antennal length | -ve  |  -ve   |
| F9 length       |  0   |   0    |
| Wing length     | -ve  |   0    |
| Wing area       | -ve  |   0    |
| Wing loading    |  0   |  -ve   |

::: notes
-  Negative allometry suggests that larger individuals do not benefit from disproportionate investment in wings or antennae
- biomech could be stabilising selection
- antenna length still appears to be important in mate location
:::

## Summary {visibility="hidden"}

-   Sexual size dimorphism is present in this species
-   Female biased sexual size dimorphism is likely driven by scramble competition
-   Larger individuals do not benefit from disproportionate investment in wings or antennae
-   Stabilising selection likely generates negative allometries (perhaps due to biomechanical restraints)
-   Male biased antennae likely used in mate location (suggesting chemical cues are important in mate location)

## Conclusion

-   There is potential for an edible insect industry in New Zealand
-   However this needs to be tempered by previous company failures
-   Huhu grubs are a possible candidate
-   Thesis as starting point for the careful development of edible insects in NZ
